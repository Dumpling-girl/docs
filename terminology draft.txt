# Terminology

- [**Blockchain**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/guide/blockchain-guide-everything-you-need-to-know/) - A shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.

- **Consensus Protocols** – A set of rules that define the instructions for how to be an autonomous participant in a distributed computer network and come to an agreement about the exact state of common data.

- **Developers** - Individuals or organizations that build applications and services using the Helium Network infrastructure.

- **Discord** - A web-based community chat platform.

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) - A web-based platform that allows developers to collaborate, manage, and store their code repositories.

- **H3 Index**: H3 is a system of managing global datasets and is pervasive throughout different Helium protocols.

- **Helium** - A global decentralized wireless network of networks utilizing a token-incentive model.

- [**Helium Improvement Proposals (HIP)**](https://github.com/helium/HIP) - A bill for changes to the network.

- [**Helium Network Token (HNT)**](https://docs.helium.com/tokens/hnt-token/) - The native token of the Helium Network, used for incentivizing and securing the decentralized wireless network of networks through redemption and swap features.

- **Hotspot Owners** - Individuals or organizations that deploy and maintain Helium-compatible wireless devices (Hotspots) to provide network coverage.

- **IoT Device Owners** - Users of IoT devices that leverage the Helium Network for connectivity.

- [**IOT subNetwork Token (IOT)**](https://docs.helium.com/tokens/iot-token) - A token specific to the LoRaWAN Network, enabling low-power, wide-area network connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. PoC is employed for the LoRaWAN subnetwork.

- **Mobile Device Users** - Users of mobile devices that access the 5G Network through the Helium Network infrastructure.

- ]**MOBILE subNetwork (MOBILE)**](https://docs.helium.com/tokens/mobile-token) - A token specific to the 5G-CBRS Network, facilitating high-speed mobile connectivity and data transmission. PoC is employed for the 5G subnetwork.

- **Node** - Refers to individual devices or computers that participate in maintaining the network by storing a copy of the blockchain, validating transactions, and relaying information to achieve consensus.

- **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)** - A unique digital identifier that is recorded on a blockchain and is used to certify ownership and authenticity. It cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided.

OUI 

- **Proof-of-Coverage (PoC)** - A unique consensus algorithm employed by the LoRaWAN and 5G subnetworks, which rewards participants for verifying wireless network coverage.

- [**Proof-of-History (PoH)**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-history-and-how-does-it-work/) - A consensus protocol unique to Solana, Proof-of-History is a verifiable and sequential timestamping mechanism that provides a trustless and efficient ordering of events in the blockchain.

- [**Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-beginners-guide/) - A PoS-system is a type of blockchain consensus protocol that achieves verification by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency.

- [**Redundancy**](https://docs.helium.com/iot/coverage-mapping/#mappers-visualization): The total count of IoT Hotspots that heard a mapper from within this hex. This metric is helpful in understanding the resilience of the Network in a given area.

- **Repository** - A storage location that contains all the files, documentation, and version history of a project.

- [**RSSI**](https://docs.helium.com/iot/coverage-mapping/#mappers-visualization): 'Received Signal Strength Indicator' is a measure of the power present in a received radio signal. This number is computed by the IoT Hotspot when it hears the signal from a mapper. The higher the signal (less negative), the ‘stronger’ it is considered.

- [**SNR**](https://docs.helium.com/iot/coverage-mapping/#mappers-visualization) - 'Signal to Noise' measures the ratio of received power to background power in the received signal. Like the RSSI, it is also computed by the IoT Hotspot when it hears signal from the mapper. A higher ratio represents a clear signal whereas a negative number in this field represents a noisy signal.

- [**Solana**](https://solana.com) - A blockchain that uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism to provide smart contract functionality as well as a mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH), which uses hashed timestamps to verify when transactions occur.

- **Locking-Up (or 'Staking')** - The act of temporarily locking up tokens as collateral to participate in block validation and consensus mechanisms, earning rewards for supporting network operations or generating Voting Power.

- **Token** - Tokens are digital assets that utilize cryptography for secure transactions, represent value, and can be used for various purposes within a decentralized network or ecosystem.

- **Validators** - A distributed network actor responsible for verifying and validating transactions and blocks, maintaining the network’s security and consensus.

- [**veHNT**](https://docs.helium.com/governance/faq#what-is-vehnt) - A position created by locking up HNT tokens. Used for voting on proposals that affect the entire Helium Network of Networks model.

- [**veIOT**](https://docs.helium.com/governance/voting/#veiot) - A position created by locking up IOT tokens. Used for IOT Network governance.

- [**veMOBILE**](https://docs.helium.com/governance/voting/#vemobile) - A position created by locking up MOBILE tokens. Used for MOBILE Network governance.

- [**Vote Escrowed ('ve')**](https://docs.helium.com/governance/voting/#vote-escrowed-positions-as-nfts) - A position created by locking up tokens that only functions for Network or subnetwork voting. Vote Escrowed positions appear in Helium Wallets as NFTs and are non-transferrable.

- [**Voting Power**](https://docs.helium.com/governance/voting/#voting-power) - Specific network tokens will give you Voting Power in the designated Network or subnetworks. Voting Power is your token amount multiplied by the duration of a lock-up period. Voting Power creates a weight of your vote against others. 100 veHNT is more than ten veHNT. The higher amount would mean you have more weight in deciding vote outcomes. The more HNT you lock-up for veHNT, the more voting power you have. 

- **Wallet** - A digital application designed for interacting with blockchain-based applications. Wallets enable users to store and manage their digital assets, such as digital tokens and NFTs.
