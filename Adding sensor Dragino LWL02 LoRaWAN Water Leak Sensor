LWL02 -- LoRaWAN Water Leak Sensor

The Dragino LWL02 is a LoRaWAN Water Sensor. When there is water between the two metal probes, the LWL02 indicates a water leak event and uplinks to an LNS server via a LoRaWAN network. The LWL02 will send periodic data every day as well as for each water leak event. It also counts the water leak times and calculates the last water leak duration. Users can also disable the uplink for each water leak event, instead, the device can count each event and uplink periodically.
