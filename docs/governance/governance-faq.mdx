## What Is veHNT?

veHNT represents the Voting Power of the Helium Network.

In the Helium ecosystem, HNT holders can receive veHNT by locking HNT tokens on-chain for a
specified period in exchange for voting rights and Voting Power in the Helium Network as defined in
[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md).

Additionally, veHNT provides other benefits, such as earning MOBILE or IOT tokens, if the holder
delegates veHNT to those subnetworks, respectively. After the lockup period ends, the same amount of
HNT is released back to the owner's wallet and is now transferable, if needed.

## What Are The Benefits of Locking HNT after The Subnetworks Launch?

Now that the Solana migration has been completed, HNT holders can use the locked veHNT to vote on
proposals in the Helium Network and help the Network make collective decisions, influencing the
future of the Network.

HNT holders will additionally be able to delegate veHNT to a subnetwork for token rewards.
Delegating veHNT to a subnetwork will count towards the DAO Utility Score, the `V` value referenced
in
[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model).

## Where Does the HNT Go after Receiving veHNT?

When HNT tokens are locked for veHNT, the HNT tokens will become veHNT and remain entirely in the
wallet's custody. veHNT ownership is represented by a non-transferable Solana NFT held in the Helium
wallet. At the end of the lock-up period, any received tokens first need to be claimed, the position
undelegated, and then after a close position action is taken HNT will be back in the wallet 1:1 for
the HNT that had been locked previously.

## What Is a "Lock-Up" Period?

A lock-up period is a window of time when users are not allowed to transfer HNT.

A lock-up period will incur when HNT is locked for veHNT. The lock-up period is between 1 day and 48
months selectable in days but with block granularity.

Lock-up periods help incentivize long-term HNT holders and deter short-term speculators and those
with shorter-term interests in the governance of the Network.

## What is Voting Power?

Voting Power is the weight of the vote towards decisions made by the Network or subnetworks. The
more veHNT a HNT holder has, the more weight is assigned to that vote.

Voting Power can only be increased by locking more HNT or extending an existing veHNT lock-up period
for a longer period.

## How to Choose a Subnetwork to Lock Tokens?

[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)
defines that all subnetworks return a maximum of 6% of their token emissions to their veHNT
delegators and is designed to be an equal maximum reward level across all subnetworks so that no
network can buy their way to a higher DAO Utility Score.

Rewards can be lower than 6% in subnetwork tokens if the subnetwork votes to provide a lower token
reward in return for other benefits or similar.

As more veHNT is delegated to a subnetwork, the DAO Utility Score improves, among other factors
defined in HIP 51, which drives greater rewards of HNT for the subnetwork.

As more veHNT holders delegate to a particular subnetwork, individual holder rewards will reduce the
amount of net subnetwork token earnings as delegators share the 6% subnetwork token emissions.

The more veHNT is delegated to a subnetwork, the more the subnetwork's DAO Utility score increases
and the more HNT the subnetwork gets at each epoch improving the HNT/subnetwork Token ratio. But the
more veHNT delegated, the more veHNT holders will have to share the rewards from the 6% token
emissions.

## How to Lock Tokens By Using veHNT?

Anyone can lock any amount of HNT and lock it up for 1 day to 1461 days (48 months). Choose the
unlock date at the time of lockup or decide to keep it on a rolling lock-up period, called "constant
lock-up", or the veHNT decay process, before initiating the locking period. The HNT locked is
exchanged for veHNT, which provides two benefits:

- Voting in the Helium Network on new subnetwork proposals and participating in the governance.
- Receiving a reward if the veHNT is delegated to a subnetwork.

Anyone can delegate veHNT to a subnetwork, it's one component of a subnetwork's DAO Utility Score.
Delegating veHNT to a subnetwork allows the holder to earn subnetwork token rewards proportionally
based on the subnetwork's rules.

> For example: If a token holder delegates some veHNT to the Mobile subnetwork, the token holder
> proportionally earns MOBILE rewards allocated to veHNT holders.

The Helium Network encourages long-term participation in voting and governance. Those who lock HNT
for 1 day will exchange 1:0.06844627 HNT to veHNT. Those who lock HNT for 48 months will receive an
exchange of 1:100 HNT to veHNT. Any period in between will be treated on a linear scale from
0.0684462 to 100.

> For example, the token holder chooses to lock 10 HNT for six months. The token holder receives 125
> veHNT. If the token holder decides to unlock immediately, after six months, that veHNT decays to 0
> until 10 HNT unlocks and is available for use in the wallet.

A combination of an amount of HNT locked for a specified duration and the assigned veHNT is called a
"Position". It is possible to own multiple Positions in the Helium wallet. Actions taken on a
Position - e.g. on the lock-up duration, delegating the veHNT, voting with the veHNT - are all or
nothing options. If a Position owner would like to receive rewards from two subnetworks, then the
HNT-veHNT Position would need to be split into two Positions - by transferring some HNT to a second
position within the same wallet. Then each position could delegate to a different subnetwork.
Similarly, wishing to extend the lock-up duration on parts of a Position requires a similar split by
transfer.

## How Can veHNT be obtained?

Locking HNT for veHNT will be done on [Helium Vote](https://heliumvote.com/hnt/staking) See the
[Locking veHNT on Helium Vote](/governance/staking-with-realms) documentation.

## Is There a Locking "Genesis" Period?

For the first ten days after Helium's migration onto Solana, there was a 3x multiplier bonus for new
veHNT owners. This is called the "Landrush" multiplier.

New veHNT owners were only eligible to receive this veHNT bonus during the initial ten-day Landrush
period. HNT locked now, after this period will receive veHNT at the normal rate with no multiplier.

This landrush period ended at 23:59:59 UTC on April 28, 2023.

For example:

> Locking 10 HNT during this Landrush period with a lock duration of six months receives 375 veHNT
> (10x12.5x3) that, if a cooldown is selected, decays from 375 to 0 veHNT at the end of the locking
> period, and 10 HNT is returned to the wallet.

> Locking 20 HNT during this Landrush period with a lock duration of 24 months returns 3000 veHNT
> (20x50x3), and at the end of the locking period, 20 HNT is returned to the wallet.

## Will HNT be earned by Locking HNT For veHNT?

**No.** HNT locked for veHNT will not earn more HNT, it will only return what was staked at the end
of the selected lock-up period.

However, when HNT is locked for veHNT, that veHNT can be delegated into one or more subnetworks
(such as IoT or Mobile subnetworks), and the subnetworks allocate up to 6% of their token emissions
to the veHNT owners delegating to that subnetwork.

> For example: When veHNT is delegated to the IoT subnetwork, every epoch IOT tokens can be claimed
> in the Helium Wallet. If chosen, this IOT can then be burned at the IOT subnetwork treasury for
> HNT, or the IOT tokens can be held, or locked for veIOT.

## How much veHNT will be received for each lock-up period?

The table below shows the approximate HNT to veHNT multiplier for example months of staking.

This value is multiplied by 3x during the first 10 days after the Solana transition and this
multiplier lasts as long as the last lock-up period selected in the first 10 days after the Solana
migration.

| Months staked | veHNT received |     | Months staked | veHNT received |
| :-----------: | :------------: | --- | :-----------: | :------------: |
|    1 week     |      0.5       |     |      12       |      25.0      |
|    2 weeks    |      1.0       |     |      15       |      31.2      |
|       1       |      2.0       |     |      18       |      37.5      |
|       2       |      4.1       |     |      21       |      43.7      |
|       3       |      6.2       |     |      24       |      50.0      |
|       4       |      8.3       |     |      27       |      56.2      |
|       5       |      10.4      |     |      30       |      62.5      |
|       6       |      12.5      |     |      33       |      68.7      |
|       7       |      14.5      |     |      36       |      75.0      |

## Does a veHNT Owner Have to Delegate veHNT to a Subnetwork?

No. A veHNT owner can hold the veHNT as is or delegate it to a subnetwork at any time.

:::note

Changing delegation is allowed, but any delegation changes within a Solana Epoch will void any
delegation rewards within that Epoch. A Solana Epoch is 24 hours long and starts and ends at
00:00:00 UTC time.

:::

## How Granular Is The veHNT Linear Decrease?

The veHNT decay countdown starts when initiated from the Wallet App/Helium Vote, either immediately
in "decay" mode or after a "constant lockup" is unlocked and cooldown has started.

veHNT quantity decay is granulated per second even though the Epoch period is 24 hours.

It is the current delegated veHNT value at the start of an Epoch that is used for calculating the
subnetwork's DAO utility Score during the Epoch.

A 48-month lock-in period has approximately 1461 linear steps between 100 veHNT and 0 veHNT.

> 4 years x 365.25 days epochs per day = 1461 steps

After 1 day has passed after locking a single 1 HNT for 48 months, the quantity of veHNT in the
wallet will decay from 100 veHNT to 99.86311 veHNT. This decrease will recur linearly over the
remaining 48 months until it hits zero.

## Can The Lock-up Period Be Increased At Any Time?

Yes. The lock-up period can be increased by extending it to a maximum of 48 months at any time, and
the increase activates at the start of the next epoch. If the veHNT is delegated it must be first
undelegated, change the period, redelegate, and lose delegation rewards within that 24 hour Epoch.
If those three actions take longer than an epoch or are split over two epochs then delegation
rewards are lost for two Epochs.

## Can the Lock-Up Period be Decreased For Fast Access to the HNT and Take a Penalty?

No. The lock-up period is defined at the time of locking and cannot be unlocked or decreased for any
reason.

## Can Extending the Lock-Up Period be Automated?

Yes, a constant rolling lock-up period is available called Constant Lock-up. The decay countdown
start point will need positive action to start the lock-up cooldown period.

> Staking 10 HNT for 4 years will get approx 1000 veHNT and this will be a rolling 4-year period and
> will remain at 1000 veHNT until the decay countdown is activated and this will then decrease
> linearly over 4 years to 0 veHNT and the HNT is then returned.

## Can veHNT or any of the veDNTs be Transferred to Someone Else?

No. veHNT and the like are fully non-transferable and represent your Voting Power in the Network. It
is not a token. It is represented in the wallet by a non-transferable NFT.

## How Can One Buy veHNT or Any of the veDNTs?

veHNT, veIOT or veMOBILE cannot be bought. They are not tradable tokens. veHNT can only be obtained
by locking HNT with a lock-up period. Likewise, for veIOT or veMOBILE.

veHNT and veDNTs have no value in the larger crypto markets.

## What Is the DAO Utility Score?

The DAO Utility score is described in
[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)

Every epoch, a fixed amount of HNT is allocated to all subnetworks. Each subnetwork receives a share
of this fixed amount. The sizes of the shares are determined by the DAO Utility Scores of each
subnetwork of Helium.

The higher the DAO Utility Score of a subnetwork is in relation to the DAO Utility Scores of all
other subnetworks combined, the higher its share of the total HNT allocated to all subnetworks. As
the DAO Utility Scores are calculated each epoch anew, the share of HNT a subnetwork receives may
change from epoch to epoch.

Delegating veHNT to IoT or Mobile subnetworks increases the `V` value in the
[HIP-51 DAO Utility Score](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)
calculation.

The two other ways the DAO Utility score can be increased are:

1. Increasing the amount of data usage on the subnetwork, i.e., the Data Credits burned. This
   increases the `D` value in the DAO Utility Score.
2. Increasing the Data Credits used to onboard the number of Hotspots for that subnetwork. This
   increases the `A` value in the DAO Utility Score.

## Will Subnetwork Earnings Remain The Same Over The Time Period Lock-Up?

No, they are calculated and paid to the lock-up position per epoch - daily. They may increase when:

- More veHNT is delegated in the subnetwork a veHNT owner delegated to - that treasury gets more
  HNT.
- More Hotspot onboarding fees are burned in the subnetwork a veHNT owner has delegated to.
- More data is transferred and burned in the subnetwork a veHNT owner has delegated to.

They may decrease when:

- More veHNT is delegated in the subnetwork a veHNT owner delegated to - that share is reduced
- More veHNT is delegated to other subnetworks - other treasuries get more HNT.
- The delegated veHNT decays over time after it has entered the cooldown.
- More Hotspots are online in other subnetworks with a non-zero onboarding fee.
- More data is transferred and burned in other subnetworks.

Thus, it can be observed that delegating more or all veHNT to a specific subnetwork has the
opportunity to both increase or decrease your subnetwork earnings from delegation.
