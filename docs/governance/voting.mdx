To go from a proposed HIP to a vote, the Helium Community follows the process initially laid out in
HIP 7. Rough consensus and running code are critical factors for achieving approval. Rough consensus
is achieved in partnership with HIP Authors, as well as non-binding Temperature Checks in the Helium
Discord. Temperature Checks allow the community and all stakeholders discussing the HIP to signal
readiness or suggest more time for discussion. HIPs progress through different stages, including
Draft, In Discussion, Approved, Deployed, or Rejected.

## Blockchains + On-Chain Voting

The Helium Network, uses on-chain voting to maximize inclusive participation and maintain a publicly
auditable voting record. On-chain voting means storing a piece of data on a blockchain. The
blockchain acts as an immutable ledger. To store data on a blockchain, users must pay a small
transaction fee, which covers the data storage cost permanently. The Helium Network utilizes the
Solana blockchain for blockchain-based data storage. The Solana blockchain has fast processing times
and low fees, keeping costs accessible to all participants for small transactions like voting and
governance. Storing voting data on a blockchain ensures transparency and immutability of the voting
process.

Today, the Helium Network utilizes the tool
[Modular Governance](https://modular-governance.helium.com/) for on-chain voting. Since the passage
of HIP 51 - 53, the Helium Network established the distinction between Networks and subnetworks,
currently represented by a token for each. HIP 51 - 53 also established the Vote-Escrowed Model of
token locking for Voting Power.

## The veToken model

The veToken model originated from
[Curve (veCRV)](https://resources.curve.fi/crv-token/understanding-crv/) as a native token
initiating a lockup and creating voting rights. Curve's native token is CRV and has three functions:
voting, rewards, and boosting yield. To perform any of those functions, CRV is required to be locked
in the form of veCRV. The "ve" in veToken stands for "vote-escrowed." Today, this model has been
emulated by various DeFi protocols within many Layer 1 ecosystems. The Helium Network has adopted
the model originally introduced and passed by the community in HIP 51.

The veToken initiatives within the Helium Network serve two primary purposes: maximizing rewards,
specifically for protocol emission earnings and governance. Governance seeks to establish the best
outcomes for new projects, new initiatives, and for the future of decentralized wireless.

## The Amount of veTokens for Governance

In the context of the Helium Network, the veToken model's primary use is to establish voting
strength and governance rights. The additional on-chain object (the veToken) represents that
wallet's voting strength.

The veToken model requires users to lock the underlying token, locking the tokens for a period of up
to four years. The longer the locking period, the greater the voting strength. By locking tokens,
economic interests and voting rights are effectively aligned. The native token holders retain the
tokens' economic value and utility, while the veToken assumes the voting rights. All Helium veTokens
are non-transferable, 'soulbound', and have zero intrinsic economic value. They are represented by
an NFT in the Helium Wallet App.

## Locking tokens

To vote in the Helium Network for changes to either the Network at large, the IoT (LoRaWAN)
subnetwork, or the Mobile (5G) subnetwork, a participant must lock tokens: HNT, IOT, or MOBILE
tokens.

Locking tokens is a process of locking a token amount (as little as one token) for a specific period
of time in an on-chain program on the Solana blockchain. This program defines the parameters for
locking. In the Helium Network and subnetworks, users can lock tokens for up to 4 years. Locking
allows users to make a commitment to the future, creating long-term alignment to increase the value
of the Network.

:::note How to lock tokens

For a full walk-through on how to lock tokens to the Helium Network or one of its subnetworks, see
the [Locking Tokens][voting-power] guide.

:::

## Voting Power

Specific network tokens will give Voting Power in the designated Network or subnetworks. Voting
Power is the token amount multiplied by the duration of a lock-up period. Voting Power creates a
voting weight against other token holders. This Voting Power enables token holders with strong
incentive alignment with the network to have greater influence over governance decisions. The
function of locking and Voting Power applies to any new subnetworks in the future, as per the
community-passed and approved HIP 51.

## Vote-Escrowed Positions as NFTs

When token holders stake a token, a veToken position will be received in the Helium wallet. 've'
represents the vote-escrowed position created by locking tokens for a voting power multiplier. For
all users, the veToken positions will be shown in a web3-wallet as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These
NFTs are not tradable or transferable and are considered 'soulbound' to the wallet. Vote-escrowed
simply means the tokens sit in an escrow period until the locking position is over, and are only to
be used for voting and governance while in escrow.

### veHNT

[Helium Vote][heliumvote-helium] and the Helium Network serve as the overarching system that enables
a multitude of networks (subnetworks) to exist. As such, veHNT's role in network governance is in
matters affecting the entire network. For example, a proposal affecting HNT emissions would be voted
on using veHNT.

Additionally, veHNT can be [delegated][delegate] to a subnetwork in order to earn a portion of that
network's tokens.

### veIOT

The [IoT subnetwork][heliumvote-iot] focuses on the original vision of the Helium Network,
supporting the growth and development of IoT devices and applications. Staking IOT tokens to the IoT
subnetwork grants veIOT which can be used to vote on matters specific to the IoT network. For
example, a proposal affecting Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) behavior for IoT Hotspots.

### veMOBILE

The [Mobile subnetwork][heliumvote-mobile] is dedicated to the growth and expansion of the Helium
Network in the mobile and telecommunications sectors. Staking MOBILE tokens to the Mobile subnetwork
grants veMOBILE which can be used to vote on matters specific to the Mobile network. For example, a
proposal affecting Proof-of-Coverage behavior for Mobile Hotspots.

## Supermajority

A proposition is deemed 'Approved' and accepted by the community if it achieves a super-majority of
67% of the Voting Power. This is not a new rule for the Helium Community and was first established
in Phase 2 of Governance.

The duration for which a proposal must be made available for voting is not predetermined. Generally,
voting occurs within seven days.

## Quorum

A quorum of tokens represented must be met to certify the proposal as a valid outcome. The quorum is
100,000,000 tokens represented at the time of the vote in the vote results. This quorum is equal
across the Network and all subNetworks. If a proposal does not reach this quorum, the proposal will
automatically fail. Even if the proposal received a 67% super majority of Voting Power, the proposal
did not reach quorum and therefore is invalidated.
