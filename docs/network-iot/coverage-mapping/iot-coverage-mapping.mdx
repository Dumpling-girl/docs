The [Helium Mappers Coverage map](https://mappers.helium.com) is a crowd-sourced effort to build a
true-signal coverage map of the Helium IoT Network across the globe. By mapping real-world coverage,
network users can understand where sensor deployments are likely to have success connecting to the
Helium IoT Network.

> Coverage mapping should only be done from ground level, or slightly above it. We would like the
> map to indicate the expected coverage a standard sensor device would experience. If you want to
> fly a GPS tracker on a balloon or aircraft, please do not contribute this data to the coverage
> map.

## Mapping Projects

### Helium Mappers

Helium Mappers lets you see the areas that have been explored by participants in the coverage
mapping project. The map also shows the Helium IoT Hotspots that have provided coverage to these
areas. Helium Mappers uses the H3 hexagon tiles to aggregate survey results and provided statistics.

View Mappers data at [mappers.helium.com](https://mappers.helium.com/).

### Helium Cargo

Cargo is an evaluation tool for LoRaWAN GPS tracking devices. It shows the current location of these
devices, along with the coverage of the Network as an H3 hex grid. While Helium Mappers shows an
aggregate view of the Network coverage, Cargo can display specific mapper devices by name, and their
most-recent position reports.

View GPS trackers on Cargo at [cargo.helium.com](https://cargo.helium.com/).

### CoverageMap.net

Coverage Map is a third-party tool that draws heatmaps for LoRaWAN networks. This tool has the
ability to show raw survey results for devices and IoT Hotspots. It aggregates coverage measurements
into a heatmap, radar plots and alpha shapes. View Helium's heatmap at
[CoverageMap.net](https://coveragemap.net/).

## Mappers Visualization

From within the [Mappers tool](http://mappers.helium.com), clicking on a green hexagon will allow
you to get more information about the coverage available in that region.

- **H3 Index**: The funny looking number like `89283082853ffff` is the unique H3 index of the
  hexagon on the map. In other words, it's the hex's name. H3 is a system of managing global
  datasets and is pervasive throughout different Helium protocols.
- **RSSI**: 'Received Signal Strength Indicator' is a measure of the power present in a received
  radio signal. This number is computed by the IoT Hotspot when it hears the signal from a mapper.
  The higher the signal (less negative), the 'stronger' it is considered.
- **SNR**: 'Signal to Noise' measures the ratio of received power to background power in the
  received signal. Like the RSSI, it is also computed by the IoT Hotspot when it hears signal from
  the mapper. A higher ratio represents a clear signal whereas a negative number in this field
  represents a noisy signal.
- **Redundancy**: The total count of IoT Hotspots that heard a mapper from within this hex. This
  metric is helpful in understanding the resilience of the Network in a given area.
- **Distance**: This is the approximate distance of the mapper from the IoT Hotspot that heard it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does Mappers work?

Participants use low-cost LoRaWAN devices to survey the real-world Network created by Helium. Many
contributors bring their mapper with them when they walk, hike, bike, drive or even boat! These
mappers are small and fit well in a pocket or on a car dash. Some have set up their mappers so
they're contributing to the coverage map every time they take a drive.

In order to place a mark on the map, the mapper device sends out a signal with a GPS location
encoded. If a Helium IoT Hotspot 'hears' that signal, data is passed through the Internet and
recorded in the Mappers database. The Mappers database uses the GPS information from the Mapper to
'light up' the hex on the map.

### Why should I contribute to Mappers?

There are a variety of ways that Mapping is valuable to both IoT Hotspot Owners and network users.
For Hotspot Owners, the collected data helps to visualize the coverage provided by all Helium IoT
Hotspots - identifying areas where coverage is lacking or even where IoT Hotspot placements could be
made that would participate in Proof-of-Coverage with other IoT Hotspots. A marked hex on the map
indicates that uplink signals from registered Helium LoRaWAN sensors have been proven to be 'heard'
by the Helium IoT Network somewhere within that hex shaped area.

For Network users, the map proves the real-world coverage that IoT Hotspots provide. This is like
looking at the Verizon or T-Mobile map when evaluating phone plans, but for business users. This
real world evidence at the scale and resolution offered by our map gives prospective Network users
the information they need to make decisions about their deployments. As an example, this map is what
someone like Lime scooters would look to before they sign a contract.

In short, a robust map means high priced customers, which means adoption, which means the Network
grows and the token value increases.

### Do I earn rewards for contributing?

No, coverage mapping is entirely voluntary. To participate in mapping, you will need to spend Data
Credits (DCs) to pay for the Data Transfer that your mapper uses. HNT can be converted to DC to fund
device Data Transfer or DC can be purchased directly through the official
[Helium Data Credits Portal](/tokens/data-credit-portal).

Mapping does not make an IoT Hotspot earn more IOT tokens through Proof-of-Coverage. The real value
is to prove the Network, drive adoption, and increase the purchase of Data Credits by commercial
users.

If the IoT Hotspots that you are mapping are your own, those Data Credits are paid back to your IoT
Hotspots in the form of IOT. IoT Hotspots earn IOT for data packets they transfer, for mapping or
otherwise.

### How can I use Mappers for my own IoT Hotspot deployments?

- Find new locations for IoT Hotspots.
- Get real-world information about how far your IoT Hotspot reaches.
- Learn RF data analytics in an interactive way.

### How can I use Mappers for my own sensor deployments?

Take a mapping device to the area where you want to deploy sensors and watch to see if it is picked
up by an IoT Hotspot in the hex where you want to deploy a sensor. If it's picked up by only one IoT
Hotspot, decide if you want to deploy an additional IoT Hotspot in that area for sensor connection
redundancy. Look at existing mapped areas for confirmation that your sensors can be deployed in that
area and how many IoT Hotspots can pick them up. It only takes one IoT Hotspot to receive and
transmit data through the Internet, but the redundancy offered by the Helium IoT Network helps to
ensure that your data is received.
