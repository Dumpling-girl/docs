The Helium IoT Network uses a unique consensus algorithm called "Proof-of-Coverage" (PoC) to verify
that IoT Hotspots accurately represent their location, configuration, and the wireless coverage they
create.

Proof-of-Coverage incentivizes Hotspot Operators to deploy IoT Hotspots in underserved areas and
report their deployments accurately so that users of the Helium IoT Network can see where coverage
is likely to be available.

## Why Proof-of-Coverage

The Helium IoT Network is a physical wireless Network that succeeds based on the reliable coverage
it can create for users deploying connected devices. As such, it required a working algorithm built
for this use case.

Proof-of-Coverage leverages unique, undeniable properties of radio frequency (RF) propagation to
produce meaningful proofs to the Helium IoT Network and its participants. Specifically, PoC relies
on the following characteristics:

- RF has limited physical propagation and, therefore, distance.
- The strength of a received RF signal is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from
  the transmitter.
- RF travels at the speed of Light with (effectively) no latency.

The Helium IoT Network uses the data generated by ongoing proofs to verify the wireless coverage
provided by IoT Hotspots on the Network.

## Oracled Proof-of-Coverage

- Oracled Proof-of-Coverage ChainVar was set in block 1,731,335.
- The first Oracled Proof-of-Coverage Receipts were in block 1,731,339.
- "Bitter Concrete Parakeet" is the animal name of the Injector Oracle for Oracled PoC.

Oracled PoC moves the responsibility of validating all PoC events to dedicated Oracles, powerful
machines that ingest completed challenges, verify challenges, and witness validity, then inject the
results back into the Helium IoT Network for rewards to be issued.

Oracles interact with data and systems outside of a native blockchain environment where the
processing can be completed much more efficiently and at scale, providing a solution to a
fundamental limitation of smart contracts.

Oracled Proof-of-Coverage allows IoT Hotspots running miner version `2022.12.13.0` or later to
"self-beacon", transmitting Beacons on their own to participate in Proof-of-Coverage, ensuring more
reliable Beacon events.

At the start, IoT Hotspots self-beacon every 6 hours, though this time window may change as Oracled
PoC is improved. The Beacon rate includes a "jitter" component to offset the Beacon timing across
IoT Hotspots on the Helium IOT Network to avoid overloading the Oracles with large data spikes.

Oracled PoC is essential in implementing [HIP-70][hip-70] and the Helium Network's migration to the
Solana blockchain and is a significant step forward in increasing the usability and scalability of
the Helium IoT Network.

## PoC Reward Scaling

Rewards for Beacons and Witness events under PoC are prioritized by a scheme that was introduced
under [HIP-17][hip-17], which was designed to pay higher rewards for Beacon events that are
transmitted from less-covered areas as a way to encourage Helium IoT Hotspot owners to deploy IoT
Hotspots in these areas and discourage deployments in areas that are already densely covered.

PoC currently judges an area as over- or under-served by consulting a table of density scale values,
which dictates how many IoT Hotspots are needed to effectively cover a given area.

As each IoT Hotspot is added to or removed from the Helium IoT Network, the Oracle examines the
deployment and how it affects the IoT Hotspot count at each of the seven scales, computing a new
Transmit Scale (TS) for every IoT Hotspot in the regions affected.

If the change is an addition to the Helium IoT Network which increases the density of IoT Hotspots
at a particular scale beyond the ideal density, every IoT Hotspot in that region has its Transmit
Scale reduced.

Currently, there are seven “targets” in the list, each of which is a pairing of an area scale and
the ideal number of IoT Hotspots that should be deployed at that scale.

In every epoch, rewards split amongst IoT Hotspots that had a role in that reward pool.

For example, an IoT Hotspot might earn a "reward unit" for witnessing a beacon. If five additional
IoT Hotspots successfully witnessed a Beacon during the epoch, each IoT Hotspot earns a "reward
unit." In that case, each Hotspot gets 1/6th of the 20% of rewards in that epoch.

The activation of [HIP-15][hip-15] and [HIP-17][hip-17] introduced the idea of scaling these reward
units. So the units earn when being witnessed or witnessing a packet scale depend on two things:

1. The number of Witnesses, as detailed in [HIP-15][hip-15]
2. The number of IoT Hotspots in the hex tile of the transmitter, detailed in [HIP-17][hip-17]

The HIPs themselves provide a rich explanation of these mechanisms, but they can be summarized as
follows:

**From HIP-15**

- For the Transmitters: The more witnesses, the more the transmitter earns.
- For the Witness: Each additional Witness past a total of four reduces what is earned by each
  Witness in that challenge.

**From HIP-17**

- The Witness earns less if the number of IoT Hotspots in the area of the transmitter exceeds the
  "target density." Target density varies by hex resolution, as detailed in the HIP and defined in
  several chain variables.
