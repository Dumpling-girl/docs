Because Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) is such an important part of the Network's success and continued
growth, it must adapt to change. Change comes in many forms, but the key changes that have happened
since the start of the Helium IoT Network are:

- The Helium IoT Network has grown exponentially
- Newer radio hardware has been developed
- Newer LoRaWAN features have arisen
- Attempts to subvert PoC have grown in sophistication
- The Helium Network has been re-organized to be more scalable (HIP-70
  <sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>)</sup>)
- The Helium IoT Network has diversified; there are more actors and roles available
- A talented and committed Community has continued to grow as more IoT Hotspots come online

## The Current Plan

While some of these changes are challenges to overcome, most of them are improvements that have
remained as untapped resources &mdash; until now. Each of the items in the roadmap that follows
either capitalizes on one of these improved resources or addresses one of the difficult challenges.

It is also important to recognize that many ideas for improvements to PoC have been proposed by Core
Developers and Community members, not all of which are a part of this immediate roadmap. After we
accomplish the most fundamental steps, improvements that may otherwise have been tabled because they
were deemed too complex to implement will become viable and reconsidered.

### Step 1: Oracle-Based PoC - In Progress

From the launch of the Helium Network in 2019 until February 2, 2023, the IoT PoC system relied on a
“Challenger, Beaconer, Witness, Validator, Rewarder” model. In this model at least five separate
actors had to work together to make PoC events happen. Any break in the chain meant the loss of the
entire event and its rewards.

#### A History of Artificial Limits

Over time, the Core Developers noticed breaks in this chain and have had to enact limits to PoC to
keep it functioning under the extraordinary demand generated by the growth of the Helium Network.
These limits have frustrated Hotspot Owners and Network Users alike by making it hard to see just
how effective changes and additions to Hotspot setups were. These limits included:

- A Hotspot could only expect to Beacon roughly once every two days, and
- Only 14 Witnessing IoT Hotspots could be recorded in the results

#### Room to Breathe

With the adoption of HIP-70, the Core Developers have been able to adopt a newer, higher performing
model known as “Oracle-Based PoC”. Oracle-Based PoC brings two important improvements:

- It eliminates the Challenger role, allowing IoT Hotspots to be in charge of their own Beacons, and
- It shifts PoC validation to a higher performance actor, known as the **IoT PoC Verifier Oracle**.

The Verifier Oracle can process and validate PoC events with significantly less overhead than
before, when PoC events had to be validated under strict real-time deadlines by the Members of the
currently elected Consensus Group, and which often led to events silently being dropped just to keep
the blockchain moving.

### Step 2: Removing the Limits to PoC

Now that Oracle-Based PoC is in effect, we can begin to remove some of the restrictions that had
been holding PoC back. In short, we will:

- Increase the Beacon rate, and
- Separate Witness reports from Witness Rewards.

#### Increasing the Beacon Rate

Increasing the Beacon rate per IoT Hotspot will provide the Helium IoT Network and Hotspot Owners
with more timely measurements, which in turn will allow them to make improvements with confidence
and allow Network users to quickly see new areas of coverage. Increasing the Beacon rate will be
evaluated by the [IoT Working Group](/governance/working-groups/#iot-working-group) as a potential
upgrade to functionality on the Helium IoT Network.

#### Publishing the Full Witness List

Under Oracle-Based PoC we can now separately report the entire list of Witnesses to every Beacon
without also requiring the entire list to be represented on the blockchain, which is solely
dedicated to handing out rewards for the event. The ability to separate these concerns is important
because many IoT Hotspots are routinely Witnessed by many more than the 14 Hotspots reported in the
blockchain rewards transaction, but until now there simply was no place to report them.

With the advent of Oracle-Based PoC, the IoT PoC Verifier Oracle can publish a side report, off
chain, of the entire witness list to each and every Beacon on the Helium IoT Network.

### Step 3: Economic Scale Adjustments

We should reconsider each density target individually to ensure that its limit makes sense, and if
not, change it. Additionally, we should consider shortening the list and removing area scale targets
that aren’t helpful, such as the “Res 4” scale, which roughly covers an area of 1,770 square
kilometers (683 square miles).

## Future Exploration

After the previously listed steps are adopted, the way forward becomes harder to predict and the
order in which developments must be made is less certain. Nonetheless, we are certain they will
include these “Next Steps”.

### Algorithmic Experiments

With more rapid Beaconing and more stable reporting, we can begin performing experimental
adjustments to PoC that will help it measure the surrounding radio environment better and make the
algorithm more robust against simulation attacks, aka “gaming”.

It is hard to predict how effective any one of the many algorithmic proposals that these changes
will be without simply testing them. Proposed ideas include:

- Randomized transmit powers
- Randomized coding rates (Spreading Factors)
- The Addition and/or Removal of Error-correcting codes
- Reintroduction of multi-hop paths, secondary Beacons

### Modeled Coverage

Use suspicious coverage reports as a possible indicator of a misbehaving IoT Hotspot. The IoT
Proof-of-Coverage shouldn't reward for coverage that is physically impossible to provide and
Verifier Oracle should incorporate basic terrain data and electromagnetic wave propagation models to
judge the plausibility of Witness events and begin to build a trust model to identify well-behaved
IoT Hotspots amongst those that are untrustworthy.

### Worldwide Reward Harmonization

The IoT network uses several different “unlicensed” radio bands across the world. Each of these
bands comes with its own regulations, some of which can change from country to country in the space
of just a few kilometers. Some of these regulations limit the output power and dwell times that an
IoT Hotspot can use when transmitting a Proof-of-Coverage Beacon, which ultimately changes how
easily it is heard by other IoT Hotspots in the area, and ultimately affects a Hotspot's PoC
rewards.

Not all of these limits ultimately affect how well an IoT Hotspot can cover a given area, and as
such, any parameter that artificially inflates or deflates an IoT Hotspot's apparent coverage should
be accounted for when computing an IoT Hotspot's PoC rewards for a Beacon. Once Reward Harmonization
is enacted, Hotspot Owners should be able to expect their rewards to be based only on the
effectiveness and uniqueness of their coverage and not by the particular country or region in which
they are deployed.

### Secured Mappers and Concentrators

Introduce specially hardened hardware elements that can cryptographically attest to their locations
and observations. Incentivize this extra expense with extra rewards but continue to let the IoT
Network be composed of standardized and cheaper hardware.

### Permissionless Participation

Make it possible for anyone to add an IoT Hotspot to the Network and participate in PoC, just as
long as they provide the onboarding fee. The PoC algorithm will sort out who is providing coverage
and who is not. This doesn't require a specialized third party to attest which IoT Hotspots are real
and which are virtualized.
