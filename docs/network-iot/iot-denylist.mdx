## What is the Denylist?

The Denylist is a list of IoT Hotspot public keys and a cryptographic signature that have been
identified not to be accurately contributing to Network coverage or are otherwise circumventing the
good faith of the Network in an attempt to earn rewards. Rewards gaming by dishonest actors, even as
a small percentage of the Network, erodes Network integrity.

Examples include, but are not limited to: cluster packet forwarders, misasserted locations,
misasserted antennas, multiple or shared antennas, attenuators, amplifiers, and Data Credit farming.

The Denylist is another tool in a broader range of tools to incentivize IoT Hotspots on the Helium
IoT Network to provide the most honest and accurate wireless coverage possible.

The Denylist is sourced from the Community to keep the Network decentralized. Credible
decentralization ensures that no one entity can control the Helium IoT Network. Any coordinated
effort to game rewards, block data transfer, or censor information to benefit one party while
harming another, undermines the mission of creating global, open wireless networks.

The Helium Foundation has not and will never run a Denylist out of the interest of decentralization.

## Network Impact

**Hotspot Owners:** For any well-asserted, appropriately compensated IoT Hotspot, the Denylist only
benefits you. By denying token distribution to dishonest IoT Hotspots, those tokens are shared
amongst honest IoT Hotspots.

**Bad Actors:** If your IoT Hotspots are earning tokens without providing coverage, they are likely
to appear on the Denylist and will stop earning token Rewards.

## Denylist Generation

The current iteration of the Denylist classifier is a step toward the long-term evolution of
Proof-of-Coverage to dynamically evaluate Network coverage. The process is fully detailed in the
write-up from the authors of the classifier,
[IoT Denylist Evolution](/devblog/2023/08/07/denylist-evolution).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### My Hotspot appears on the Denylist. What can I do?

The most important step to take when evaluating whether an IoT Hotspot should be on the Denylist is
to double-check the asserted location of the IoT Hotspot. IoT Hotspots that are physically placed
apart from their asserted location are likely to be included. Reasserting an IoT Hotspot can be
accomplished in the [Helium Wallet App](/wallets/helium-wallet-app).

If the IoT Hotspot is operating honestly on the Helium IoT Network, with well-attached antennas, a
clear view, and appropriately asserted attributes, further analysis of the IoT Hotspot can take
place in the official Helium Community Discord channel,
[#denylist](https://discord.com/channels/404106811252408320/984427647977283674).

### What if the Denylist doesn't include all of the gaming Hotspots?

The Denylist is one disincentive of many to keep gaming at bay. Above all, Proof-of-Coverage and
more direct detection methods all work in concert to ensure the security of PoC.

### Will the Denylist have the ability to block data transfer and/or rewards for data transfer?

IoT Hotspots on the Denylist are "denied" of Proof-of-Coverage rewards, but are still able to act as
a Data-Only Hotspot, providing Data Transfer Network Coverage where possible. It is important to
understand the uninterrupted Data Transfer ability in the case of errant Denylist inclusions.
