A LoRaWAN Network user did not have to do anything during the migration. The network continued to
function. Data transfer remained to be unaffected during the Solana Migration.

During the Solana Migration, users may have still purchased Data Credits with a credit card on
Console. However, users would be unable to acquire DC through a direct HNT burn on Console.

Core developers actively monitored Network performance to ensure that systems stayed operational.
