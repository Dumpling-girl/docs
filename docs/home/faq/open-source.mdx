# Helium is Open-Source

The Helium Network is built almost entirely on open-source code. And we actively encourage the
Community to develop and contribute to all parts of the Network. Below is a subset of the code that
plays an integral role in the Helium Network. The full list can be found on the official
[Helium GitHub Org](https://github.com/helium).

## Helium Blockchain

:::The following information about the Helium Blockchain pertains to the time when the Helium Blockchain was its own L1 Blockchain.
Some of the information is publicly archived on GitHub.

:::

These are the core libraries and Repos that make up the Helium Blockchain. Most things here are
written in Erlang.

- [Miner](https://github.com/helium/miner) - The Helium Blockchain miner.

- [Blockchain Core](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-core) - The glue that ties together things
  like the `Helium miner` and the `blockchain api`.

- [Blockchain API](https://github.com/helium/blockchain-api) - A full blockchain node that exposes a
  JSON API. It's ideal for supplying data to things like block explorers and mobile apps.

- [Erlang HoneyBadgerBFT](https://github.com/helium/erlang-hbbft) - An Erlang implementation of
  HoneyBadgerBFT's various protocols.

- [Erlang DKG](https://github.com/helium/erlang-dkg) - Helium's implementation of the protocol
  described in [Distributed Key Generation in the Wild](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/377.pdf).
  Prepare yourself for some math.

- [Erlang libp2p](https://github.com/helium/erlang-libp2p) - Libp2p swarms written in (you guessed
  it) Erlang.

- [Helium CLI Wallet](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs) - Command Line Interface a(CLI), written
  in Rust, used to create and administer Helium Wallets, and interact with the Helium Network.

- [Helium JS](https://github.com/helium/helium-js) - Typescript SDKs for interacting with the Helium
  Blockchain.

- [Packet Purchaser](https://github.com/helium/packet-purchaser) - Service that buys Helium LoRaWAN&trade;
  packets from the Network and delivers them to a target LoRaWAN&trade; Network Server (LNS).

- [Angry Purple Tiger](https://github.com/helium/angry-purple-tiger) - Ever wonder how your IoT Hotspot
  got its cute little animal name? Here it is.

## LoRaWAN&trade;

The Helium Network is the largest, public LoRaWAN&trade; Network in the world. This is some of the code
that makes it possible.

- [Packet Forwarder](https://github.com/helium/packet_forwarder) - Helium's fork of the LoRa packet
  forwarder.
- [Light Gateway](https://github.com/helium/gateway-rs) - The next-generation packet forwarder for
  the Helium-enabled gateways.

- [Helium Console](https://github.com/helium/console) - A web browser front-end for users to manage
  organizations and devices and a Helium Network-compatible LoRaWAN&trade; Network Server (LNS).

- [Console Decoders](https://github.com/helium/console-decoders) - A collection of LoRaWAN&trade; sensor
  decoders used in Helium Console.
