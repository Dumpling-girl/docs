# FAQ - Helium Network

### What is the Helium Network?

The Helium Network is a decentralized, blockchain-based wireless infrastructure project that allows
individuals and organizations to deploy and operate wireless networks through token incentivization.
It leverages the Solana blockchain for its foundation.

The primary token powering the network is HNT, while IOT and MOBILE tokens are used to facilitate
the LoRaWAN and 5G subnetworks, respectively. Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) is a unique consensus
algorithm employed by the subnetworks.

Today, the Helium Ecosystem, and its <a href="https://explorer.helium.com/">hundreds of thousands of
Hotspots</a>, deployed by a global community, provide access to the largest decentralized wireless
network in the world. [Watch this helpful introduction video](https://youtu.be/Vx9YyS7-d3g).

### Why is the Helium Network called The People’s Network?

We call it The People’s Network because the people who deploy Hotspots build and operate the
network. It’s powered by them and owned by them.

### Who governs the Helium Network and what is the Helium Foundation?

The Helium Foundation is a global not-for-profit dedicated to the proliferation of secure,
cost-effective connectivity, and it manages and maintains the open technologies that support the
Helium Network. You can read more about governance from the Helium Foundation on their
[website](https://helium.foundation).

### How does the Hotspot work and what does it power?

Hotspots enable people to own and operate a wireless network that supports a wide range of Internet
of Things (IoT) devices, from smart pet collars and home delivery systems, to smart bikes and
scooters, medical transport and tracking devices, cooling systems, smart lighting systems, and more.
[Here’s a helpful video about how Helium works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67aQeZTaqNY).

### Does Helium replace the Wi-Fi in my house?

No. Hotspots receive radio signals and route packets from low-power devices in your area that use
LoRaWAN, a wireless protocol, and have been deployed to the Helium Network. Typically these are
devices such as GPS trackers, environmental sensors, weather meters, etc., that only need to
transmit and share small bits of information. The Hotspot uses your existing Internet (via Wi-Fi or
Ethernet) to deliver the data packets sent by these devices. It does not replace Internet or
cellular service for regular devices such as computers and smartphones.

### If I connect the Hotspot to my Wi-Fi, am I breaking the terms of service with my Internet provider?

The Helium Network is not in the position or business of giving legal advice. In general, users
should check the terms with individual providers and comply with applicable law.

### How far does the Helium Network reach and does it use radio frequency?

Helium’s LoRaWAN technology, the combination of the Helium blockchain and LoRaWAN wireless protocol,
uses sub-GHz radio frequency between 860 and 923 MHz. Depending on conditions, Helium LoRaWAN can
reach dozens of miles or kilometers and even connect devices that are inside buildings, unlike GPS
and cellular signals.

### What kind of cryptocurrency do I earn?

Hotspot owners earn IOT tokens.

Helium 5G Hotspot owners and Helium Mobile hotspot owners earn MOBILE tokens.

### How do Hotspots earn IOT?

Hotspots earn IOT by providing wireless coverage and transferring data from nearby devices. The more
data transferred the larger the reward. Previously, Hotspots earned HNT tokens.

### How do Helium 5G Hotspots earn MOBILE?

Helium 5G Hotspots earn MOBILE by providing 5G wireless coverage and verifying the Helium Network.
Earning MOBILE by providing 5G coverage requires a 5G Hotspot and one or more compatible online
Radios. These Radios must also be registered in the SAS (Spectrum Access System) maintained by the
FCC.

### How much IOT will I earn?

Hotspot owners earn IOT depending on how frequently their devices do two things:

- Validate the Network - IoT Hotspots transmit data to each other to confirm that the Network is
  secure and owners receive rewards when their IoT Hotspot participates in a process called
  Proof-of-Coverage (PoC). You can find more information about
  [Proof-of-Coverage (PoC)](/iot/proof-of-coverage) under the IoT Network heading at the top of the
  website.
- Move Data for Device Users - If an e-scooter, pet tracker, air quality sensor or other device uses
  an IoT Hotspot to transmit data, the owner of the IoT Hotspot receives rewards based on how much
  data is transferred.

### What if I'm in a rural area, or the only Hotspot in my area? Can I still earn rewards?

It's best to have at least one or two other Hotspots within radio range of you so that you can
participate in the Proof-of-Coverage consensus algorithm to earn IOT rewards at a higher rate. If
you are the only Hotspot in your area, you will earn IOT if a device uses your IoT Hotspot's
connection to transfer sensor data back to the sensor users. IOT is distributed based on these
economics. Read the information about
[token economics](https://docs.helium.com/tokens/hnt-token#hnt-token-economic-concepts) to learn
more.

### Can I connect my phone or computer to Hotspots?

Yes. As of early 2022, the community has started to roll out 5G-CBRS Hotspots in the USA. Read about
[4G/LTE and 5G coverage on the Helium Network](https://www.helium.com/5G) to learn more.

### Does the Helium community have a Discord?

The Helium Discord is the primary communication channel for the Helium Network community and it is
the primary venue to get support for using the Network. The Helium Discord is moderated by the
Community Managers of the Helium Foundation and independent members of the Helium community.
