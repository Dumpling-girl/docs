# FAQ - Helium Network

<LegacyContentBanner />

### What is the Helium Network?

Helium is a global, distributed network of Hotspots that create public, long-range wireless coverage
for LoRaWAN-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) devices. LoRaWAN&trade; Hotspots produce and are compensated in IOT, the
native cryptocurrency of the Helium IoT Network, now on the Solana blockchain.

Today, the Helium IoT Network, and its <a href="https://explorer.helium.com/">hundreds of thousands of Hotspots</a>,
deployed by a global community, provide access to the largest decentralized LoRaWAN Network in the world.

### Why is the Helium Network called The People’s Network?

We call it The People’s Network because the people who deploy Hotspots build and operate the
Network. It’s powered by them and owned by them.

### Who governs the Helium Network and what is the Helium Foundation?

The Helium Foundation is a global not-for-profit dedicated to the proliferation of secure,
cost-effective connectivity, and it manages and maintains the open technologies that support the
Helium Network. You can read more about governance from the Helium Foundation on their [website](https://helium.foundation).

### How does the Helium IoT Hotspot work and what does it power?

Hotspots enable people to own and operate a wireless network that supports a wide range of Internet
of Things (IoT) devices, from smart pet collars and home delivery systems to smart bikes and
scooters, medical transport and tracking devices, cooling systems, smart lighting systems, and more.

### Does Helium replace the Wi-Fi in my house?

No. Hotspots receive radio signals and route packets from low-power devices in your area that use
LoRaWAN&trade;, a wireless protocol, and have been deployed to the Helium Network. Typically these are
devices such as GPS trackers, environmental sensors, weather meters, etc., that only need to
transmit and share small bits of information. The Hotspot uses your existing Internet (via Wi-Fi or
Ethernet) to deliver the data packets sent by these devices. It does not replace Internet or cellular
service for regular devices like computers and smartphones.

### If I connect the Helium IoT Hotspot to my Wi-Fi, am I breaking the terms of service with my Internet provider?

The Helium Network is not in the position or business of giving legal advice. In general, users
should check the terms with their internet service providers and comply with the applicable law.

### How far does the Helium Network reach and does it use radio frequency?

Helium’s LoRaWAN&trade; technology, the combination of the Helium Blockchain and LoRaWAN&trade; wireless protocol,
uses sub-GHz radio frequency between 860 and 923 MHz. Depending on conditions, Helium LoRaWAN&trade; can
reach dozens of miles or kilometers and even connect devices that are inside buildings, unlike GPS
and cellular signals.

### What kind of cryptocurrency do I earn?

Helium IoT Hotspot owners earn IOT tokens.

### How do Helium IoT Hotspots earn IOT?

Helium IoT Hotspots earn IOT by providing wireless coverage and transferring data from nearby devices. The more
data transferred the larger the reward. Previously, Helium IoT Hotspots earned HNT tokens.
[Watch this helpful video about HNT and Data Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0JOB88MHSI).

### How much IOT will I earn?

Helium IoT Hotspot owners earn IOT depending on how frequently their devices do two things:

- Validate the Network - IoT Hotspots transmit data to each other to confirm that the Network is secure
  and owners receive rewards when their IoT Hotspot participates in a process called Proof-of-Coverage (PoC).
  You can find more information about [Proof-of-Coverage (PoC)](/iot/proof-of-coverage) under the IoT Network
  heading at the top of the website.
- Move Data for Device Users - If an e-scooter, pet tracker, air quality sensor or other device uses
  an IoT Hotspot to transmit data, the owner of the IoT Hotspot receives rewards based on how much data is
  transferred.

### What if I'm in a rural area, or the only IoT Hotspot in my area? Can I still earn rewards?

It's best to have at least one or two other IoT Hotspots within radio range of you so that you can
participate in the Proof-of-Coverage consensus algorithm to earn IOT rewards at a higher rate. If you are the
only IoT Hotspot in your area, you will earn IOT if a device uses your IoT Hotspot's connection to transfer
sensor data back to the sensor users. IOT is distributed based on these economics. Read the information about
[token economics](https://docs.helium.com/tokens/hnt-token#hnt-token-economic-concepts) to learn more.

### Can I connect my phone or computer to IoT Hotspots?

Yes. As of early 2022, the Community has started to roll out 5G-CBRS Hotspots in the USA
[4G/LTE and 5G coverage on the 5G subnetwork of the Helium Network](https://www.helium.com/5G).

### Does the Helium Community have a Discord?

The official Helium Discord is the primary communication medium for the Helium Network Community and it is
the primary venue to get support for using the Helium Network. The Helium Discord is moderated by the Community
Managers of the Helium Foundation and independent members of the Helium Community.
